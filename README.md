# Fridge Tracker App

A collaborative project designed to reduce food waste and improve fridge organization by providing users with tools to track contents, monitor expiration dates, and optimize storage space.

## Features
- **Track Fridge Contents:** Easily log and view all items in your fridge.
- **Expiration Notifications:** Get reminders for items nearing their expiration dates to minimize waste.
- **Shared Fridge Management:** Organize shared fridge spaces and monitor what others add or use.
- **Space Tracking:** Visualize how full your fridge is at a glance.
- **Intuitive Design:** Developed with user-friendly interfaces and high-fidelity prototypes in Figma.

## Development Process
- Conducted user research through interviews, surveys, and usability tests to identify key pain points such as disorganization and forgotten items.
- Designed interactive user flows and high-fidelity prototypes in **Figma**, refining designs based on usability feedback.
- Applied a user-centered approach, ensuring the app aligns with real-world needs and reduces friction in fridge management.

## Collaboration
This was a group project for **CSC318: The Design of Interactive Computational Media** at the University of Toronto. The successful collaboration involved task delegation, regular team meetings, and iterative feedback from stakeholders.
